//Explanation:



//This code checks whether a given number is a prime number by using a loop that runs from 1 to the value of `num`. Inside the loop, it checks how many numbers divide `num` exactly (i.e., with no remainder). For example, when `i` is 1, `num % i == 0`, so the count is incremented by 1. As the loop continues, the count only increases again when `i` equals `num` itself (since a number is always divisible by itself). If, after the loop, the total count of divisors is exactly 2, meaning the number is divisible only by 1 and itself â€” the program concludes that it is a prime number. Otherwise, it's not prime.
